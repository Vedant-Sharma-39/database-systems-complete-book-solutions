\subsection{13.7 Variable-Length Data and Records}

\subsubsection*{Exercise 7.1}

$$
4 + (3 - 1) \times 4 + 3 \times 10 = 42 \ \mathbf{bytes}
$$

Here, I briefly talk about the meaning:

\begin{itemize}
  \item 4: Record length.
  \item (3-1): The number of pointer to variable-length fields.
  \item 3: The number of fix-length fields.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection*{Exercise 7.2}

$$
2 + 40 + \frac{10 + 50}{2} + \frac{20 + 80}{2} + \frac{0 + 1000}{2} = 622 \ \mathbf{bytes}
$$

\subsubsection*{Exercise 7.4}

For this question, we assume that there are $n$ patients.

a)

$$
4 + (40 \times n \times p)
$$

b)

$$
4 + ((40 + 4) \times n \times p)
$$

c)

$$
40k + 4
$$

d)

$$
k = n \times p
$$

\subsubsection*{Exercise 7.5}

Every record and record fragment requires a fragment header to support spanned records. Since
$500 < r \leq 1000$, we can store only a single record when we don't support spanned records.
Therefore, we don't use $1000-r$ bytes in this case. If we support them, we can store one record
and one record fragment and we need to use 32 bytes for fragment headers. Therefore,
if $r < 1000 - 32 = 968$, then we can improve space usage.

\subsubsection*{Exercise 7.6}

$$
\frac{8 \times 256 \times 4096}{298.262 \times 67.140125} = 418
$$

If we organize 418 chunks from different movies fit into 8 tracks
and all movies occupy consecutive cylinders, we can play as many as
418 movies with an initial delay of 100 ms.
