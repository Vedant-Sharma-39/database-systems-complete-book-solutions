\subsection{13.8 Record Modification}

\subsubsection*{Exercise 8.1}

\begin{itemize}
  \item Performances. There is no need for calculating the size of every tuple.
  \item Better space utilization. The variable-length tuples need allocation of
        space large enough for handling the maximum possible size of tuples. Many
        tuples are much smaller and thus storage space could be wasted. Thus,
        the fixed-length tuple is preferred over variable-length tuple.
  \item Simple processing. It is easy to update, insert and delete fixed-length tuple.
\end{itemize}
