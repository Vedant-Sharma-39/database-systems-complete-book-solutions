\subsection{18.1 Serial and Serializable Schedules}

\subsubsection*{Exercise 1.1}

\begin{itemize}
  \item Flight information is retrieved from database element $A$
  and $B$, which means $r_{1}(A)$ and $r_{1}(B)$.
  \item Selects a flight and flight reservation is made for the customer,
  which means $r_{1}(B)$ and $w_{1}(B)$.
  \item Customer selects a flight seat from database element $C$,
  which means $r_{1}(C)$ and $w_{1}(C)$.
  \item Get customer's credit card number and records flight bill in
  database element $D$, which means $r_{1}(D)$ and $w_{1}(D)$.
  \item Customer's phone and flight data is inserted to database element
  $E$, which means $r_{1}(E)$ and $w_{1}(E)$.
\end{itemize}

Thus we can get the following answer:

$$
r_{1}(A), r_{1}(B), w_{1}(B), r_{1}(C), w_{1}(C), r_{1}(D), w_{1}(D), r_{1}(E), w_{1}(E)
$$

\subsubsection*{Exercise 1.2}

This is a classical combinatorics question.

$$
\frac{10!}{4! \times (10 - 4)!} = 210
$$
