\subsection*{6.1 Simple Queries in SQL}

\subsubsection*{Exercise 1.1}

\begin{enumerate}
  \item If $A$ and $B$ are two different attributes, there
        must be comma between them.
  \item Because of that, $B$ is an alias for $A$, because
        $B$ is the second name, if it was that the second
        name was $A$, in that case $A$ would be an alias
        for B. Of course, we count that between them there
        is no punctuation.
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection*{Exercise 1.2}


a)

\begin{lstlisting}[language=sql]
  SELECT address
  FROM Studio
  WHERE name = 'MGM studios';
\end{lstlisting}

b)

\begin{lstlisting}[language=sql]
  SELECT birthdate
  FROM MovieStar
  WHERE name = 'Sandra Bullock';
\end{lstlisting}

\hypertarget{Solution6.1.2c}{c)}

If you interpret the question as asking only that \verb|Lover|
appear as a substring, the the following is OK:

\begin{lstlisting}[language=sql]
  SELECT starName
  FROM StarsIn
  WHERE movieYear = 1980 OR movieTitle LIKE '%Love%';
\end{lstlisting}

However, another reasonable interpretation is that we want
the word \verb|Love| as a word by itself. The query above
returns stars of a Movie \emph{The Cook, the Thief, His
Wife, and Her Lover}. To identify only titles that have
\verb|Lover| as a word by itself, either at the beginning,
the middle, the endor as the entire title, we need to use
four patterns. The following query works;

\begin{lstlisting}[language=sql]
  SELECT starName
  FROM StarsIn
  WHERE movieYear = 1980 OR
        movieTitle LIKE 'Love %' OR
        movieTitle LIKE '% Love %' OR
        movieTitle LIKE '% Love' OR
        movieTitle = 'Love';
\end{lstlisting}

d)

\begin{lstlisting}[language=sql]
  SELECT cert#
  FROM MovieExec
  WHERE netWorth >= 10000000
\end{lstlisting}

e)

This example is the same as \hyperlink{Solution6.1.2c}{c)}.

\begin{lstlisting}[language=sql]
  SELECT name
  FROM MovieStar
  WHERE gender = 'M' OR
        address LIKE 'Malibu %' OR
        address LIKE '% Malibu %' OR
        address LIKE '% Malibu' OR
        address = 'Malibu';
\end{lstlisting}

\subsubsection*{Exercise 1.3}

a) Any tuple with $a$ equal to 10 or $b$ equal to 20.

b) Any tuple with $a$ equal to 10 and $b$ equal to 20.

c) Any tuple except $a$ is \verb|NULL|.

d) Any tuple with $a$ equal to $b$ except \verb|NULL|.

e) Any tuple with $a \leq b$ except \verb|NULL|.

\subsubsection*{Exercise 1.4}

It's simple.

\begin{lstlisting}[language=sql]
  SELECT *
  FROM Movies
  WHERE length > 0;
\end{lstlisting}
