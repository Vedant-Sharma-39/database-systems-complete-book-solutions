\subsection*{6.1 Simple Queries in SQL}

\subsubsection*{Exercise 1.1}

\begin{enumerate}
  \item If $A$ and $B$ are two different attributes, there
        must be comma between them.
  \item Because of that, $B$ is an alias for $A$, because
        $B$ is the second name, if it was that the second
        name was $A$, in that case $A$ would be an alias
        for B. Of course, we count that between them there
        is no punctuation.
\end{enumerate}
