It is possible! In the $\gamma$, we need to produce all the aggregations
that the \verb|HAVING| clause uses. Then, we can follow the $\gamma$
by a $\sigma$ that eliminated from the result of the $\gamma$
the tuples that correspond to the groups that the \verb|HAVING| would eliminate.
Finally, we use $\pi$ to get rid of the extra aggregations that
were used only by the \verb|HAVING| clause.
