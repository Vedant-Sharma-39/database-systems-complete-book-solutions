\subsubsection*{Exercise 1.2}

UML is structured data model and its schema dependent and is less flexible. On the other side,
semistructured data is more flexible than structured data but less. As far as scalability
in structured data it is very difficult to scale DB schema, on the other hand in
semistructured data it's scaling is simpler than structured data. But
essential difference between this two models is:

UML is based on Relational database table and semi-structured model is based on XML/RDF.
