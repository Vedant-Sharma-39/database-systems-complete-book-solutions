\subsection*{5.3 A Logic for Relations}

\subsubsection*{Exercise 3.1}

Example of the Datalog rule which is finite with the head relation:
Datalog rule we have: $R(x, y) \ \mathbf{AND} \ z = z$. The expression
here is $z = z$. The actual datalog rule are the head predicate
has finite relation if the predicates of relational sub goals
have finite relation. The head relation for the above example
is finite and hence it violates the condition. This violation
is irrespective of the finite relations that are assigned to
the relational predicates.
